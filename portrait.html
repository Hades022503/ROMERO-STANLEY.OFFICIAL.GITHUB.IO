        You're the one that never lets me sleep
To my mind, down to my soul
You touch my lips
You're the one that I can't wait to see
With you here by my side
I'm in ecstasy
I am all alone without you
My days are dark without a glimpse of you
But now that you came into my life
I feel complete
The flowers bloom, my morning shines
And I can see
Your love is like the sun
That lights up my whole world
I feel the warmth inside
Your love is like the river
That flows down through my veins
I feel the chill inside
Every time I hear our music play
Reminds me of the things that we've been through
In my mind, I can't believe it's true
But in my heart the reality is you
I am all alone without you
My days are dark without a glimpse of you
But now that you came into my life
I feel complete

The flowers bloom, my morning shines
And I can see
Your love is like the sun
That lights up my whole world
I feel the warmth inside
Your love is like the river
That flows down through my veins
I feel the chill inside
Your love is like the sun
That lights up my whole world
I feel the warmth inside
Your love is like the river
That flows down through my veins
I feel the chill inside
Your love is like the sun
That lights up my whole world
I feel the warmth inside
Your love is like the river
That flows down through my veins
I feel the chill inside
Your love is like the sun
That lights up my whole world
I feel the warmth inside
Your love is like the river
That flows down through my veins
I feel the chill inside
Your love, your love...
You're the one that never lets me sleep
To my mind, down to my soul
You touch my lips
You're the one that I can't wait to see
With you here by my side
I'm in ecstasy
I am all alone without you
My days are dark without a glimpse of you
But now that you came into my life
I feel complete
The flowers bloom, my morning shines
And I can see
Your love is like the sun
That lights up my whole world
I feel the warmth inside
Your love is like the river
That flows down through my veins
I feel the chill inside
Every time I hear our music play
Reminds me of the things that we've been through
In my mind, I can't believe it's true
But in my heart the reality is you
I am all alone without you
